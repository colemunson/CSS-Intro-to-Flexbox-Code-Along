# Intro to Flexbox Code Along

Remember the Documentation:

[Flexbox was created to create a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space in a container - especially when the size is unknown or dynamic. - CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

## What we are building

We will use flexbox to build a simple watercolor swatch site.

## Getting Started

Let's open our code and see what is there
 - complete `index.html`
  - Web page structure:

    - all elements are wrapped in a div with a class of wrapper.
    -  Within the wrapper:
    - h1 tag
    - main with a class of container
      - main has two elements
        - aside (that has a navigation and unordered list)
        - section (that contains our 'cards')

 - `code-along.css` : this is where we will do all our work

**Note**: the `nav` display is set to `none`. We are going to style it later, so we can just hide it for now. We can confirm our CSS is linked by checking that the nav HTML elements do not appear on our page.

Firstly, the images are massive. Let's write a temporary rule to keep them small

```css
img {
  max-width: 175px;
  height: 125px;
}
```

Add a universal rule to draw a gold (easier to remember 1px solid gold) or teal (easier to see) border around every element.

```css
* {
  border: 1px solid teal;
}
```

Our page should look (more or less) like this. There might be some minor differences based on your browser & size of your browser.

We will see that each of our `cards` that has an image, an h3 tag and an anchor tag inside an h4 tag and they are block elements.

There are two styling elements in flex - parents and containers

Unlike other CSS declarations, display flex only targets the immediate children

### Setting a Flex Container

```css
section  {
  display:flex;
}
```

We now have all of our cards as flex items, but they extend past their container.

Let's add a declaration so that the items wrap to the next line

```css
section  {
  display:flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

```

**Note**: different amounts of cards may be on each row, depending on the width of your browser

### Justify Content

How do we space out our cards evenly?

We can justify the content and there are a few options - let's try a few


```css
section  {
  display:flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
}

```

Once we are done trying out a few options, let's add and keep `space-evenly`
```css
section  {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  /* justify-content: center; */
  /* justify-content: space-around; */
  /* justify-content: space-between; */
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

```

### Now let's work on setting up our navigation

Comment out `display:none` on the `nav` element.

Let's make the parent container that holds our `main` and `aside` display flex:

```CSS
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

Very little space is given to our nav/aside; So let's make the aside be 20%

```CSS
aside {
  min-width: 20%;
}
```


##### Progress Check

### Let's vertically center our nav

Make aside flex container
```CSS
aside {
  min-width: 20%;
  display: flex;
}
```

and let's center that nav!

``` CSS
aside {
  min-width: 20%;
  display: flex;
  align-items:center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

Let's polish our site a little more. Sometimes a bit of polishing helps us visually understand what is going on:

Comment out our border rule, and go into the `index.html` and link our `main.css`
